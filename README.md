## Game: Kitchen Fallout

### Description
In Kitchen Fallout you play as a chef whose food has been transformed into hideous monsters by toxic waste, and it looks like you're on the menu. Dodge their attacks and defeat them with your trusty kitchen utensils, but watch out, take three hits and it's game over.

Press space to toggle shooting. WASD or arrow keys to move.

You go bald when you have 1 life left.
